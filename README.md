## Project Goal

## Features to Implement

- [] Create a method called "substrings".
- [] The "substrings" method should have two paramaters `substring(sentence, dictionary)`.
- [] The first paramter takes your word as the first argument.
- [] The second paramter takes an array of valid substrings.
- [] Each word should return a hash listing each substring that was found in the original string. So JavaScript should return "Java" and "Script".
- [] If it was repeated multipule times it should return a number value.
- [] (optional) grab the user input and let the user try and make their own custom value.
